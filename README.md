Doom Emacs
After hearing about ~Emacs~ for some time, I began using it last year. Initially, I hesitated due to its steep learning curve and the time investment it required. However, the challenge has been quite rewarding. ~Emacs~ has revolutionized my daily computer interactions. Although I used to rely heavily on the mouse, ~Emacs~ has shifted my workflow to be more keyboard-centric, enhancing my overall experience.

The standout feature for me is ~Org-mode~, which has significantly improved my productivity. It makes other text editors, like Microsoft Word, seem less capable by comparison. I wonder why I wasn't aware of ~Org-mode~ sooner.

Currently, I use ~Emacs~ for a variety of tasks including writing documents, managing blogs, creating Hugo websites, composing and checking emails, navigating the terminal, and editing LaTeX documents. I'm looking forward to learning more about its features, such as the agenda, Org-roam, and others.

In this blog post, I aim to discuss exporting to PDF with Org-mode. After extensive research and watching numerous tutorials, I've established a modest configuration. I'm still refining a few tweaks to better suit my workflow, drawing inspiration from various sources online. I welcome advice from experts to help streamline and enhance my configuration.
